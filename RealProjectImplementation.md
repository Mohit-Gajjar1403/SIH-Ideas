# ✅ Real-World Implementation Plan – Gamified Environmental Awareness Platform

## 1️⃣ Overall Architecture

* **Frontend**
  Mobile App (Flutter) or Web App (React/Next.js)
  Features:

  * Quiz Game (1v1)
  * Trash Sorting Game (Single-player weekly challenge)
  * Knowledge Base (Videos + Articles)
  * Eco-points, Leaderboards, Badges

* **Backend**
  Node.js + Express or Firebase Functions
  Handles:

  * User Authentication (Firebase Auth)
  * Matchmaking (Active Users Queue)
  * Quiz Questions / Trash Game Logic
  * Eco-points & EI Rating System
  * Interschool Leaderboards
  * Admin Dashboard for Content Management

* **Database**
  Firebase Firestore or MongoDB
  Stores:

  * Users (profile, school\_id, eco-points, EI rating, lastTrashGameDate)
  * Quiz Question Pool (id, text, options, correct answer, tags, difficulty)
  * Match Data (match\_id, questions, scores)
  * Knowledge Base Metadata (video URL, text content)

---

## 2️⃣ Eco-Points & Rewards System

* Points awarded for:

  * Correct quiz answers
  * Trash bin game success
  * Completing real-life eco-tasks (optional for future)
* Rewards:

  * Digital badges and certificates
  * Eco-themed goodies via sponsorship (CSR from eco-friendly companies)
  * Discount vouchers from partners

---

## 3️⃣ Knowledge Base Implementation

* Dynamic content fetched via APIs (YouTube Data API, government/NGO open APIs).
* Admins can manually upload videos or articles.
* Displayed in-app as educational sections with videos and short articles.

---

## 4️⃣ Quiz 1v1 Match Implementation

* When a 1v1 match starts:

  1. Generate a unique `match_id`.
  2. Select N random questions using deterministic shuffling (based on `match_id`).
  3. Both players see same set of questions in same order.
  4. No per-user question history tracking required.
  5. Players submit answers in real-time → backend updates scores + EI ratings.
  6. Leaderboards updated.

---

## 5️⃣ Trash Sorting Game Implementation

* Single-player game, played once per week.
* DB stores `lastTrashGameDate` per user.
* Simple game → user drags garbage pieces to correct bins.
* On success → eco-points awarded.
* Weekly restriction enforced by checking the last play date.

---

## 6️⃣ Interschool Events Implementation

* Each user has a `school_id`.
* Points from games aggregated into a school-level leaderboard.
* Top schools displayed in leaderboard with total eco-points.
* Interschool competition awards bonus points to top players from winning schools.

---

## 7️⃣ New Quiz Question Addition

* Admin Dashboard → allows adding new questions manually (question + options + correct answer + difficulty + tags).
* Periodic backend jobs (cron) can fetch new questions from trusted APIs (e.g., Open Trivia DB or Government APIs).
* All new questions saved in DB → ready for future matches.
* No need to track per-user attempts; random selection avoids repetition.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This system is designed to be scalable, reliable, and easily expandable in the future:

* Eco-points + EI Ratings keep users engaged.
* Knowledge base stays dynamic with API integration.
* Sponsor-based rewards make it sustainable.
* Simple, fair question selection enables smooth 1v1 competition.
* Trash game incentivizes weekly engagement.

# 🚀 How We Will Build & Showcase the Project in SIH 2025 Hackathon

## ✅ 1️⃣ Core Goal

Build a **working prototype** that demonstrates:

* 1v1 Quiz Game (Random Questions)
* Weekly Trash Sorting Mini-Game (Single-player)
* Knowledge Base (Sample Videos + Articles)
* Interschool Competition (Predefined Quiz Topics)

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ What Will Be Built During the 36-Hour Hackathon

### 🌟 User Authentication

* Simple login using Google Auth or Email
* Each user has `school_id`, `eco-points`, and `EI rating`.

---

### 🌟 Quiz Game – 1v1 Matchmaking (Random Topics)

* Users can challenge each other in real-time 1v1 quiz matches.
* Matchmaking happens via active user queue.
* For each match:

  * A unique `match_id` is generated.
  * N random questions are selected from a predefined static pool (no predefined topics).
  * Both players receive the same set of questions.
  * Answers are scored live → Eco-points and EI ratings updated in the user profile.
  * Simple real-time visual interface showing questions, scores, and winner.

---

### 🌟 Interschool Competition – Predefined Topic-Based Quiz

* Weekly event where **two schools compete head-to-head**.
* Each school has up to **20 players**.
* Each player is matched with one player from the opposite school → exactly one 1v1 match per player.
* All quiz questions are from a **predefined topic (chosen in advance)**, so students can prepare ahead of time.
* After all 20 individual matches:

  * Count total wins per school → Display winning school.
  * Top performers of the winning school receive extra eco-points.
  * Points and leaderboard are updated live.

---

### 🌟 Trash Bin Mini-Game (Single-Player Weekly Challenge)

* Simple drag & drop game where garbage pieces fall → user drags to correct bin.
* Each user can play the game **once per week**.
* Eco-points awarded for correct actions.
* Enforced by checking `lastTrashGameDate`.

---

### 🌟 Knowledge Base

* Static collection of sample articles and videos (stored locally in JSON).
* Each quiz question links to related knowledge topics → Users can click to read or watch educational content.

---

## ✅ 3️⃣ Demo Flow for Judges

1. User logs in → Dashboard shows eco-points and available actions.
2. 1v1 Quiz Challenge → Matchmaking → Real-time questions → Scoring and winner shown.
3. Trash Bin Game → User plays the weekly challenge → Points awarded + next available date shown.
4. Knowledge Base → Sample articles and videos accessed via UI.
5. Interschool Competition → Simulate two schools (with up to 20 players each) → Predefined topic quiz → Show school points tally → Declare winning school → Show top players receiving extra points.

---

## 🎯 Why This Works for Hackathon

* Simple and reliable prototype in 36 hours.
* Interactive and visually demonstrable flows.
* Balanced between random challenge (1v1 quiz) and fair preparation-based competition (interschool event).
* Clear demonstration of points, badges, and leaderboard.
* No complex external API integration → Everything hardcoded or locally simulated for the demo.

Absolutely, Here is the **corrected and clean real-world implementation plan**, based exactly on your clarified idea. You can copy this directly to your documentation.

# ✅ Real-World Implementation Plan – Gamified Environmental Awareness Platform

## 1️⃣ Overall Architecture

* **Frontend**
  Mobile App (Flutter) or Web App (React/Next.js)
  Features:

  * Quiz Game (1v1)
  * Trash Sorting Mini-Game (Single-player weekly challenge)
  * Knowledge Base (Videos + Articles)
  * Eco-points, Leaderboards, Badges
  * Interschool Competition (Team vs Team)

* **Backend**
  Node.js + Express or Firebase Functions
  Handles:

  * User Authentication (Firebase Auth)
  * Matchmaking (Active Users Queue + Interschool Competition Logic)
  * Quiz Questions / Trash Game Logic
  * Eco-points & EI Rating System
  * Interschool Leaderboards
  * Admin Dashboard for Content Management

* **Database**
  Firebase Firestore or MongoDB
  Stores:

  * Users (profile, school\_id, eco-points, EI rating, lastTrashGameDate)
  * Quiz Question Pool (id, text, options, correct answer, tags, difficulty, topic\_tag)
  * Match Data (match\_id, questions, scores)
  * Knowledge Base Metadata (video URL, text content)
  * Interschool Competitions Data (schools, players, results)

---

## 2️⃣ Eco-Points & Rewards System

* Points awarded for:

  * Correct quiz answers (1v1 and Interschool)
  * Trash Bin Mini-Game success
  * Completing real-life eco-tasks (future scope)
* Rewards:

  * Digital badges and certificates
  * Eco-themed goodies (via NGO/CSR sponsorship)
  * Discount vouchers from eco-friendly companies

---

## 3️⃣ Knowledge Base Implementation

* Dynamic content fetched via APIs (YouTube Data API, Government Open Data API) or uploaded by Admin.
* Backend stores metadata → Frontend displays educational articles and videos.
* Each quiz question links to a relevant knowledge base topic.

---

## 4️⃣ Quiz 1v1 Match Implementation (Random Topics)

* Matchmaking:

  * Active users queued → Match generated → Unique `match_id` created.
  * N random questions selected from a large question pool (no predefined topic).
  * Both players see same questions in same order.
  * Answers scored in real-time → Eco-points + EI rating updated.
* Deterministic question selection → Prevents repeats without per-user tracking.

---

## 5️⃣ Interschool Competition – Team vs Team (Predefined Topics)

* Weekly competition between two schools.
* Each school has up to **20 players**.
* Predefined topic chosen in advance by Admin (e.g., “Climate Change Basics”).
* Match Process:

  1. Every player from School A is paired with one from School B → 1v1 matches.
  2. Each player answers the same set of questions from the predefined topic.
  3. Individual match results are stored.
  4. School with more wins becomes the winner of the week.
  5. Top players from the winning school receive extra eco-points for goodies.

---

## 6️⃣ Trash Bin Mini-Game Implementation

* Single-player drag & drop game where garbage falls → sorted into correct bins.
* Played **once per week per user**.
* Backend stores `lastTrashGameDate` → Prevents repeat plays in the same week.
* Points awarded based on correct sorting.

## ✅ Example Data Flow (for Interschool Competition)

| Step | Process                                                                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Admin selects topic for interschool competition in advance.                      |
| 2    | Players from both schools register → System matches them.                        |
| 3    | For each player-pair, predefined questions (from the selected topic) are served. |
| 4    | Scores are calculated in real-time → Match outcome recorded.                     |
| 5    | School with the most individual wins is declared the winner.                     |
| 6    | Top performers of the winning school get extra points for goodies.               |
| 7    | Leaderboard updated.                                                             |

### 🔍 **Problem Addressed**

Environmental education in many Indian schools and colleges is mostly theoretical, textbook-based, and lacks real-world interaction.
Students don’t get motivated to learn about local ecological challenges, nor are they encouraged to adopt sustainable habits actively. Traditional methods fail to create lasting behavioral change or real engagement with environmental issues.

## 🚀 Project Brief Description

### 🌱 **Project Name**

Not Decided Yet

### 🔍 **Problem Addressed**

Environmental education in many Indian schools and colleges is mostly theoretical, textbook-based, and lacks real-world interaction.
Students don’t get motivated to learn about local ecological challenges, nor are they encouraged to adopt sustainable habits actively. Traditional methods fail to create lasting behavioral change or real engagement with environmental issues.

---

### 💡 **Our Solution**

We are building a **Gamified Environmental Education Platform** that turns learning into an interactive and engaging experience by combining quizzes, mini-games, and knowledge-based tasks with real-time competition and rewards.

* 🎮 **1v1 Quiz Game:**
   Students compete in real-time quizzes with random questions from a large question pool → Promotes knowledge retention and healthy competition.

* 🏆 **Interschool Competitions:**
   Schools compete in weekly topic-based quiz challenges where students face off → Encourages structured learning and preparation → Builds school-level eco-awareness.

* ♻️ **Trash Bin Mini-Game:**
   Students play a fun weekly drag & drop game to sort waste correctly → Teaches practical waste segregation habits.

* 📚 **Knowledge Base:**
   Provides videos and articles related to environmental topics → Helps students learn more and prepare for competitions.

* 🎯 **Eco-points & Rewards System:**
   Students earn eco-points by playing games and participating in competitions → Points can unlock digital badges or eco-themed goodies.

### ✅ **Impact**
